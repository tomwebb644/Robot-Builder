# Robot Builder Studio

Robot Builder Studio is an Electron-based desktop environment for designing and controlling modular robotic arms. It combines a 3D kinematic editor, a responsive motion control dashboard, and a TCP-enabled bridge that can ingest external motion commands in real time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer
- npm 9+

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Run the renderer dev server and Electron shell together:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command launches Vite (React + Three.js UI) and starts the Electron process once the dev server is ready.

### Building

Create a production build of the renderer and package the Electron app:

```bash
npm run build
```

The packaged application artifacts are generated by `electron-builder` inside the `dist` directory for your platform.

### Linting & Type Safety

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## Features

- **3D Workspace** – GPU-accelerated scene powered by Three.js with orbit controls, axes, and link visualization.
- **Joint Control Panel** – Interactive sliders per joint, with TCP takeover toggles and live value readouts.
- **Inspector Panel** – Edit joint metadata (name, motion type, axis, limits) and manage TCP control from a contextual panel.
- **TCP Bridge** – Built-in Node TCP server (default port 5555) for ingesting JSON or delimited joint commands and broadcasting state to connected clients.
- **State Management** – Zustand store coordinates UI state, remote updates, and renderer integration.
- **Responsive UI** – Dark-themed layout optimized for wide workspaces with glassmorphism-inspired styling.

## TCP Message Format

The TCP listener accepts newline-delimited payloads. Each message can be JSON or a simple delimited string:

- **JSON:** `{ "shoulder": 35, "elbow": 10 }`
- **Delimited:** `shoulder:35,elbow:10`

Only joints with TCP control enabled in the UI respond to incoming updates.

## Project Structure

```
├── electron/          # Electron main & preload processes
├── src/               # React renderer (state, components, styles)
├── index.html         # Vite entry point
├── package.json       # Scripts and dependencies
└── vite.config.ts     # Vite configuration
```

## Roadmap

- Expand the scene editor with drag-and-drop primitives and link creation tools.
- Add persistence for robot configurations and project workspaces.
- Integrate motion playback, recording, and analytics overlays.
- Provide adapters for robotics middleware (ROS, gRPC) alongside TCP control.
